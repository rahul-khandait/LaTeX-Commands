===>	If you don't want a name of a chapter/topic to be included in the tableofcontents, simply write '*' after declaring it.
Eg. 	\chapter*{Preface}



===>	To move to next page use:
	\pagebreak


===>	To use filler text "lorem ipsum", import package '\usepackage{lipsum}'
And to print text use "\lipsum[1-4]", it prints out the first four paragraphs of the the filler text.


===>	A comment starts with '%' sign
Eg.	% This is a comment 


===>     lipsum[1-1], it means first paragraph of lipsum filler text
	Do note that lipsum provides 150 paragraphs, hence the maximum limit should be 150.
	
	
Tips and Mistakes:-	
===>Always see for the error message and see the page number 
     
==> We can temporarily end the document earlier so that we could limit our field of vision and after rectifying it, we can again remove the temporary stop point. 
    For this, select a small section to find the error and temporarily close the document by using '\end{document}' 

==>Due to this, the small section would only run and we could easily rectify the errors in that small snippet, after which remove the 'end{document}' and use it appropriately to 	find further errors.
