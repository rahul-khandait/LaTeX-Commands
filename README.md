>This contains a summary of commands for using LaTeX with examples

I learned LaTeX, but honestly it requires a lot of practice and you need to remember a lot of commands, so this repository just contains the summary of the commands that i learned so far with examples and their output.

Feel free to add anything if you like.

#What is LaTeX?

LaTeX is often stylized as LATEX and is a software system for document preparation.
When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in "What You See Is What You Get" word processors like Microsoft Word,
LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter),
to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used
to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an 
intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF. The typesetting
system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and 
cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.
